Welcome to Red Automotive Insurance project! ðŸš—ðŸ’¼ I've developed a cutting-edge machine learning model to predict the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for Red customers. Red Automotive Insurance committed to providing top-notch service and personalized experiences for each of their clients.

This innovative model analyzes various customer data points, such as policy history, and demographic information, to forecast the potential value of each customer over their entire relationship with Red. This will helps Red to tailor their services and offerings to meet customers individual needs and preferences.

With the power of machine learning, Red can better understand customer behavior, anticipate their future needs, and enhance their overall experience with Red Automotive Insurance.
